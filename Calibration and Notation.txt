IMU - BNO055

What is the absolute orientation of the sensor?
Magnetometer = Magentic North with heading angle as zero degrees
Roll, Pitch are x,y
Default(Android format)
North is Y-axis -- Rotation about Y is Roll -- [-90 90] with positive when rotates from X to Z
East is X-axis -- Rotation about X is Pitch -- [-180 180] with positive when roates from Z to Y
Z pointing up --Rotation about Z is Heading [0 360) with 0 as North, 90 as East



Calibration:
Gyroscope: Completely still (1-2 seconds)
Magnetometer: figure 8
accelerometer: 45 degree increments



According to Adafruit (Serial Monitor):
e.X is Yaw/Heading (Rotation about Z-axis)
e.y is pitch (Rotation about X-axis)
e.Z is roll (Rotation about Y-axis)

to Euler Notation:
e.X is roll (Rotation about Y-axis [-90 90] +ve from X to Z)
e.y is pitch (Rotation about X-axis [-180 180] +ve from Z to Y)
e.Z is Yaw/Heading (Rotation about Z-axis [0 360) North,East..)
